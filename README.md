.dotfiles
=========
As an enthusiastic [arch linux](http://www.archlinux.org) user, I maintain a minimalistic, lightweight system for my web development work. This repo contains examples of many hours of hand-crafted system config files which all work together to make my life more efficient. I have made these available under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) for anyone who finds them useful.

The best way to use this repository is with [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), which will symlink the config files to the appropriate directories whilst maintaining the integrity of one centralised repository. For more information, see [Brandon Invergo's post](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html?round=two) on the topic.
